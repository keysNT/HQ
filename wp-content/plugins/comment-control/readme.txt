Stable tag: trunk

Gives administrators some more flexible options for controlling comments - e.g., independently setting the default comment status for Posts and Pages.

== Description ==

This plugin gives administrators more flexible control of commenting than WordPress does by default. You can set the default comment status independently for different post types (Posts, Pages etc), as well as tweak a few other things like the comment status on attachments. You can also bulk edit the comment status on all your posts at one go.

If you come across any bugs or have suggestions, please use the plugin support forum or [email me](http://rayofsolaris.net/contact/). I can't fix it if I don't know it's broken!
